**The ​​Reinforcement Learning Evolution Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to a bold vision: ​​evolving reinforcement learning (RL) while using RL to drive progress across all fields of science, industry, and society.​**

Unlike traditional foundations that focus on standardization and stability, ​​we embrace experimentation, radical innovation, and real-world impact.​​ We believe RL's true potential lies not in rigid frameworks, but in ​​breaking boundaries​​—whether in robotics, finance, or beyond.
